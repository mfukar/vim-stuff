vim-stuff
=========

The vim setup I currently use, optimized for yours truly.
I've tried to keep key mappings and commands as sane and intuitive as
possible, but I'm always open to suggestions to make it better.

Plugins
-------

* clang-complete - completion based on libclang
* tagbar - organise tags & allow navigation
* easy-align
* haskellmode-vim
* CSApprox - approximate gui colorschemes on terminals
* matchit - extends % matching
* Luc Hermitte's vim-lib, map-tools, Âµtemplate, etc.
* a slightly customized version of Tim Pope's surround
* BlobDiff - diff two arbitrary text blobs
* vsearch - visual search
* airline - and associated themes
* and others I may have left out or forgotten.
